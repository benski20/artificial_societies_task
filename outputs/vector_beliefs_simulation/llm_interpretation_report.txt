LLM INTERPRETATIONS OF BELIEF VECTOR:

  How important is college to your future?:
    Belief: This student perceives college as not important at all for her future, which may reflect a lack of confidence in higher education's relevance to her personal goals or aspirations. Her low GPA and the fact that she is not a first-generation college student might contribute to her belief that college is not a necessary path for success.
    Certainty: medium
    Demographic Influence: Being from a lower-income family and having a GPA of 2.19 may lead her to feel that college is less accessible or relevant, influencing her belief that it is not important.

  Do you feel social media increases stress?:
    Belief: The student strongly agrees that social media increases stress, indicating a significant concern about the negative impacts of social media on her mental well-being. This belief may stem from her fair mental health status and moderate social media intensity, suggesting that she feels overwhelmed by the pressures associated with online interactions.
    Certainty: medium
    Demographic Influence: As a high school student, she is likely to be heavily influenced by peer interactions on social media, which can amplify stress, particularly for someone with fair mental health.

  Would you support later school start times?:
    Belief: Her neutral stance on supporting later school start times suggests ambivalence or uncertainty about the issue, indicating that she does not have strong feelings either way. This may reflect a lack of engagement with the topic or a belief that changing start times would not significantly impact her personal experience.
    Certainty: medium
    Demographic Influence: As a student who does not participate in sports and has moderate social media use, she may not feel the urgency of needing more sleep or the benefits of later start times, leading to her neutral position.
